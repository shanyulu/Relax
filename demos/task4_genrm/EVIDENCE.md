# Task 4 GenRM elastic scaling — evidence manifest

Raw evidence (full run directories including per-request load logs and the two
failed intermediate autoscaler runs) is preserved on the
[`evidence/task4-genrm`](https://github.com/shanyulu/Relax/tree/evidence/task4-genrm/demos/task4_genrm/results)
branch. This directory carries the machine-verdict summaries of the two passing
runs so the acceptance claims are verifiable without large artifacts; every
file is hash-pinned below. Engine `host` fields are normalized to `node-0`
(single-node run; engine identity is the port) — the raw data on the evidence
branch keeps the original host values.

Run 1 (512-token budget) truncated every response inside `<think>` and never reached the judge — kept as infra-only evidence; the 2048-token budget in c78e613 is what exercises the judge path.

## Known limits of this evidence

- `max_new_tokens=8` in the consistency probe: short-generation **prefix**
  identity only, not full parseable judge output. Full reward-consistency
  comparison with per-engine attribution is pending (see the RFC's remaining
  acceptance items).
- One autoscaler round, run with experiment-tuned thresholds (per-service
  `throughput_variance_threshold=1.0`); frozen-threshold re-runs and an
  idle-phase round are pending.
- Verdicts assert Ray free GPUs returning to baseline; physical GPU memory
  recovery was captured in raw snapshots but not yet asserted together with
  PG `REMOVED` in the machine verdict.
- Failure-injection S2 intentionally waits for the configured 600 s drain
  fence after its five-second operation deadline. Its terminal operation
  status remains `FAILED`; `cleanup_required=false` after reconcile is the
  success criterion for physical completion, not a relabeling of that result.
- Preregistered autoscaler r2 passed A1–A6, A8 and B1–B2 but **failed** A7
  and B3: after each scale-in, Ray free GPUs and physical-memory samples were
  back at baseline while `len(ray.util.placement_group_table())` was 2 versus
  the pre-run baseline of 1. This is a resource-accounting blocker, not a
  threshold-tuning failure; the frozen policy was not changed and the run is
  not claimed as an autoscaler pass.
- Post-run classification settles that blocker without touching product
  code: a removed-and-confirmed `REMOVED` placement group still remains in
  `ray.util.placement_group_table()` (Ray 2.58 keeps tombstone entries;
  reproduced CPU-only), so the count grows by one per completed scale-in and
  can never return to the pre-run baseline. Since scale-in `COMPLETED`
  already requires the manager to poll Ray until the elastic PG is `REMOVED`
  before reporting physical completion (scale-in lifecycle in
  `relax/distributed/ray/genrm.py`), and free GPUs and memory did return to
  baseline within the run, the two failing verdicts are an acceptance-metric
  defect (counting `REMOVED` tombstones), not a placement-group lifecycle
  leak. The next preregistration must assert the count of non-terminal
  placement groups instead of the raw table length.
- Single-Gateway adapter accounting; direct-client / cross-gateway drain is
  not claimed.
