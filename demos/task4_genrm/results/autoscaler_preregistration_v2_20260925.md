# Autoscaler round preregistration v2 — 2026-09-25

Revision of `autoscaler_preregistration_20260925.md` for the r3 round.
Written and committed **before** the run.

## What changed vs v1 (and why)

Exactly one change, in the acceptance metric only. All thresholds,
cooldowns, load phases and semantic assertions are frozen verbatim from
v1 — none may change for r3.

- `A7_resources_returned` / `B3_resources_returned` previously asserted
  `len(ray.util.placement_group_table()) == baseline`. Ray 2.58 keeps a
  tombstone entry for every removed-and-confirmed `REMOVED` placement
  group, so the raw table length grows by one per completed scale-in and
  can never return to the pre-run baseline. r2 failed exactly these two
  assertions while Ray free GPUs and per-GPU memory returned to baseline,
  and the r2 post-mortem (commit 46ff87a) settled the failure as an
  acceptance-metric defect, not a lifecycle leak.
- **Corrected metric**: the count of placement groups in a non-terminal
  state (`state != "REMOVED"`) must equal the pre-run baseline, alongside
  the unchanged Ray free-GPU and per-GPU-memory checks.
- The r2 verdict is **not** retroactively changed: it remains recorded as
  a failed round (12/14 sub-assertions) in `EVIDENCE.md`.

## Frozen configuration (identical to v1)

Deployment: single GenRM instance (Qwen3-0.6B, 1 engine initial), one
AutoscalerService with a `genrm` service target. Identical numbers to the
v3 working configuration — frozen, including the runtime cooldown PATCH
(`scale_out_cooldown_secs=20`, `scale_in_cooldown_secs=60`):

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| min / max engines (genrm) | 1 / 2 |
| metrics_interval / evaluation_interval | 3 s / 5 s |
| condition_window | 30 s |
| genrm scale-out policy | token_usage > 0.3, queue_depth > 4/engine, queue_time_p95 > 3 s, ttft_p95 > 3 s, window 15 s, max_delta 1 |
| genrm scale-in policy | token_usage < 0.05, queue = 0, throughput_variance < 1.0, window 45 s, max_delta 1, projected_usage_max 0.9 |
| load (Round A) | 48 workers; LOW = 16-token replies (20 s); HIGH = ~1.8k-token prompts, 512-token replies until scale-out observed (300 s wait cap); STEADY = 256-token replies (60 s sampling, then screenshot capture ≤360 s, still under STEADY load); LOW′ = 16-token replies until scale-in observed (500 s wait cap, then ≤90 s history-record poll) |
| load (Round B) | none (true idle; no load generator, no timeline — scale evidence comes from `/scale_history`) |

## Round A — with-traffic cycle (preregistered assertions)

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| A1 | No scale-out decided during the LOW phase (decision ts, not poll ts) |
| A2 | Scale-out decided while HIGH is active (decision ts ∈ [high_start, high_end]) |
| A3 | The elastic engine serves > 0 requests during STEADY |
| A4 | Scale-in decided outside HIGH (decision ts ∈ [steady_start, run_end]) |
| A5 | Scale-in COMPLETED; final capacity == initial; initial engine survived |
| A6 | Zero failed load requests across the whole round |
| A7 | Resources returned: Ray free GPUs == baseline; per-GPU memory within 500 MiB of the pre-scale-out snapshot; **non-terminal placement-group count == baseline** (v2 metric) |
| A8 | Both TUI screenshots (`--service genrm` and `--service rollout`) captured live during STEADY and non-empty on disk — a failed capture fails the round |

## Round B — true-idle scale-in (preregistered assertions)

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| B1 | Manual scale-out to 2 with zero traffic reaches ACTIVE |
| B2 | The autoscaler decides scale-in on valid idle evidence (queue/running observed 0, token_usage 0 < 0.05, throughput stable) within 300 s of the manual scale-out completing, and the decision snapshot records all three conditions with zero running requests |
| B3 | Scale-in COMPLETED; final capacity == 1; initial engine survived; A7-style resource assertions hold (**non-terminal PG count == baseline**, v2 metric) |

## Stopping rules

Per-phase caps are the stopping rules: HIGH scale-out wait ≤ 300 s; STEADY
sampling exactly 60 s (screenshots after sampling, still under STEADY load);
LOW′ scale-in wait ≤ 500 s followed by a ≤ 90 s poll for the scale-in history
record; Round B scale-in decision within 300 s of the manual scale-out
reaching ACTIVE. A timeout is a functional failure of the round; no mid-run
tuning, no selective re-runs. The Round B manual scale-out reaching FAILED or
PARTIAL aborts the round as a functional failure immediately. Round B's
scale-in record is identified by `triggered_at` later than the Round B
scale-out ACTIVE moment (Round A's own scale-in is already in history).
Cleanup (serve apps, driver PG, ray shutdown) runs in an outer finally with
functional/cleanup verdicts reported separately.
