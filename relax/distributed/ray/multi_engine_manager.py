"""Common lifecycle skeleton for managers that own a pool of SGLang engine
replicas (GenRM judges, OPD teachers, ...).

Concrete managers subclass ``MultiEngineManager`` (in addition to their own
``@ray.remote`` decorator) and implement the hooks below to plug in their
engine actor class, placement, GPU/port allocation, and env vars. The base
class owns: parallel engine bring-up, health checking, dead-engine
detection/retirement, recovery, and onload/offload with idempotency tracking.

Placement is resolved per engine (not once per manager): a manager may put
all engines on one shared placement group (e.g. GenRM colocated with
rollout), or give each engine its own dedicated placement group that it
creates and tears down itself (e.g. a non-colocated OPD teacher). Subclasses
express this via ``_resolve_placement``.
